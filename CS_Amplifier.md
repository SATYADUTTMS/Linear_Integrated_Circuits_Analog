This file contains the Experiment 1 CS Amplifier files.

MOSFETs or Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor plays an important role in our day to day life because of its advantages, characteristics and numerous applications.
It can be used as a "Switch" as well as an "Amplifier". These are the 2 primary applications of MOSFETS.
There are different configurations of MOSFETs being used namely 

1.Common Source Amplifier (CS)

2.Common Gate Amplifier   (CG)

3.Common Drain Amplifier  (CD)

Out of which Common Source Amplifier has an advantage as offers a high voltage gain, good input impedance, and a relatively low output impedance compared to Common Gate and Common  Drain .

The below is the general representation of a CS Amplifier.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4af6e83-4f0e-43cd-bf48-05dd4049256e)

We observe that it consists of an NMOS ( N Channel MOSFET ) , whose gate terminal is connected with the Input voltage, the Vin applied has to be greater than the threshold voltage for the channel to form such that the current flows( drain ).

In order to supply power for the circuit , a DC Power supply has been provided at the drain terminal. The Source terminal is connected to the ground.

The drain current flows from supply to the source.Here the applied input is a voltage and we are interested to find the Output Voltage which is been amplified.

Since the MOSFET is a voltage controlled Current device , the output is the drain current. To convert this current to voltage. By Ohm's Law we observe V= I * R. Thus by applying a Resistor at the drain terminal converts this drain current to voltage.

Thus from the Output curves we know that the amplifier works in Saturation Region of MOSFET.

A Q-point (quiescent point) is set in a MOSFET to ensure it operates within its optimal region, providing the desired level of amplification and minimizing distortion and providing a stable DC operating point and also allowing for the largest possible signal swing without clipping or entering non-linear regions.

The input DC Voltage can also be set using the Voltage divider bias rule at the gate terminal.

Capacitors are the components which act as AC Short and DC open. In other words , it allows AC Component and blocks the DC Component. However the impedance of capacitor also comes into play which will be taken during the various frequency resposnse of the system.

The below is the Voltage Transfer Curve ( Vds VS Vgs ) for a MOSFET.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c12fe0eb-9a8f-4560-8c02-c3bfd965241b)

Its observed that when Vgs < Vth, the MOSFET is OFF , as a result Vds = Vdd. However When Vgs > Vth the MOSFET is ON , and if Vds >= Vov it works in Saturation Region (as required). Also if Vds < Vov the MOSFET works in Triode Region.

Now, why do we need Saturation Region ? If observed in the figure we get to know that the curve becomes almost linear in the saturation region. In an input is applied to this region the amplification is at maximum ( higher gain ). So this almost-linear region plays an important role during setting the Q-point.

An 180 deg phase shift is observed at the output. We observe that :

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc3c815f-4119-42ac-bc6d-d4a869e4f8e5)

And as a result in the input voltage increases the drain current (Id) increases, as a result the Id*Rd term increases. So the Vds value decreases with increase in Vgs . Thus its inverting.

It should also be noted that the input ac signal that we are providing has to be vgs << 2vov for proper operation of amplifier. Other wise if the positive peak is increased, then the negative side will go into the triode region and causes distortion. Also, if the negative side is increased, then the positive side will go into the cutoff region leading to clipping off of signal.

By carefully going and calculating all the parameters and applying an AC signal, its possible to get a very high gain. However we are not interested in such a high value of gain. In order to reduce and stabilize the gain at a good level, we apply a source resistor that acts as source degeneration leading to steady and stable gain.Also, by applying a bypass Capacitor the Gain increases as it helps the unwanted AC signal to bypass the source resistance.

A complete model looks something like this:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a555326-9883-4c21-87b3-d5b4f75c2e7b)

Now coming to the frequency response of the CS Amplifier,

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88a55736-efac-4362-9d47-7f62ad536e44)

Its observed that capacitive impedances come into play for lower frequencies and Mosfet capacitances also play a role at higher frequencies. Thus the difference between the Upper Cutoff frequency and Lower Cutoff frequency that is the midband frequency is the frequency range where no capacitive effect comes into play for the CS Amplifier and all the Capacitors acts as AC Short.

Q1. CS Amplifier design  having a power budget of 50uW and supply voltage of 1.8v. Input signal 50mV, frequency of 1kHz and tsmc018.lib file for LTSpice.

CIRCUIT :

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/281e3033-c79c-49b7-b47e-9be41cd80bfe)


CALCULATION :

Power = Voltage * Current

Current = Power / Voltage = 50u / 1.8 = 27.77 uA.

Since its an Amplifier to make sure that its present in Saturation Region.

Here we observe Vgs = 0.9V and Vt = 0.366V (given) , Also Vgs - Vt = Vov = 0.9-0.366== 0.534V
Thus by fundamental concept , Vds >= Vov , here 1.12V > 0.534V . Its in SATURATION .

With having L = 800nm and W = 785n, the drain current of (approx.) = Id == 27.72 uA is calculated and verified.

1. DC Operating Point :

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4a05b73-8d19-4aa1-98a6-ee215f6b239a)

The above data providing the DC biasing which is required as mentioned earlier to make sure the value of current matches with power budget and the device is working well in saturation for proper Amplification.

2. Transfer Characteristics (Id Vs Vgs):

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c1412f4-771a-4783-b3cc-08904f4fe53b)

This graph provides the details of how Id varies with input voltage Vgs and its observed that current starts to flow through MOSFET only after the Vth (0.366V) and increases exponentially.


3. Drain Characteristics (Id Vs Vds): 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1223250-eb20-4b83-b83c-d9e2c01eea5a) 

This graph provides how Id varies with Vds voltage and its observed that the current becomes constant after some value of Vds ( Vds=Vov ). This is beacuase of "Pinch-OFF Effect" due to difference in potential along the channel. Alos if we carefully observed the Current Id increases slightly as my Vds value increases the Length shortens which is inversely proportional to the current Id and hence it icnreases. If we join all these curves we get a point called as "Early Voltage". This phenomenon is called " Channel-Length Modulation" and hence the Ouput resistance is no longer infinite value but has some large finite value.
 

4. Transient Analysis:

   a. For Vin:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16d5584e-6e47-46b2-8354-9260c28d5e61) 

This graph provides variation of input AC Voltage of 50mV and Frequency 1Khz with repsect to time.

   b. For Vout:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8a63195-c0a7-4bf4-8e7b-70c7f8f7e921) 

This graph provides variation of output AC Voltage  with repsect to time.

   c. Both:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/579d0f56-b2e2-4d4c-a83e-541af00d2e9d) 

This graph shows that there is 180 degree phase shift. Blue representing the output voltage and green the input. Notice the gain in Output voltage.


5. Frequency Analysis:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/269be566-0868-46c4-9846-8419fdfec0da) 

This graph provides the Frequency Response of the Circuit. At higher cutoff frequency of 1Ghz , beyond this the Gain decreases due to effect of parasitic capacitance of MOSFET and other components.
Bandwidth is given by B.W = Upper Cutoff Frequency{Fh} - Lower Cutoff Frequency{Fl} = 1Ghz. This provides the range of frequency where no capacitance comes into play and all capacitors act as AC SHORT.

It was observed that Gm came out to be as follows :

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db0abada-5bcc-44bc-b00b-320fcc806720)  

Thus by using Gain = Gm * Rd we found the Gain to be 1.05*10^-4 * 25k == -2.625.{Minus because of the inversion}.Gain can also be Calulated as Output peak-peak by Inpit peak-peak.

If we would have used Rd as 1k then my Gain will be 0.105. To increase the gain we have increased the Rd Value.

Some extra Observations :

6. Plot of Id Vs L:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8494c6c3-fd3b-440e-b7ac-68bcd1bf1488)

Since the Id is inversely proportional to L, and thus the Id decreases.

7. Plot of Id Vs W:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d6b0801-75aa-4e04-9772-d885edefa8bf)

Its Observed from Below Equation that Current Id increases with increase in Width. 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76116661-fee5-4d26-b1bc-269450b1831e)

8. Plot of Id Vs Rd:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bc708e2-6e24-4c4d-bd88-d36361b45c91) 

Since Rd which is my load resistance increases the drain current Id decreases as per Ohm's Law, V=I*R.

9. Plot of Voltage Transfer Characteristics (Vds Vs Vgs) :

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad185da3-63da-4f7b-a93b-86eff612caca)

This is basically how the Output Voltage varies with Input Voltage for various values of the input and output sources.

Here by fundamental principle , its observed to make the MOSFET work in Saturation in almost linear part to get maximum gain. Hence the operating window should be chosen correctly and the Q point should set in suc a way for the Vds, such that there will not be any distortion or clipped part of the output signal. Basically to aloow full 360 deg swing for any changes in my voltage within the Vgs window.

Hence a CS Amplifier of Vgs = 0.9V, W = 785nm , L = 800nm , Vdd = 1.8V and Rd = 25k is designed and verified for power budget of P = 50uW.

We have also verified that P=V*I = 1.12*2.719*10^-5 will provide the value of 30uW which is well within the budget of 50uW.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q2. Replacing the resistor Rd  with a PMOS.

Instead of Resistor Rd, we can use diode-connected model configuration of MOSFET.Here the gate and drain are connected together as shown below :

Thus, in this model the drain voltage is always equal to gate voltage, ensuring that the MOSFET works always in Saturation region. We can confirm the condition of Vds>Vov={Vgs-Vt}, since Vd = Vg , the condition is Verified. Rout will be equal to 1/gm value.The Gain obtained from this graph will not have a higher value beacuase of absence of linearity part in saturation. 

Considering the channel length modulation , the Gain can be calculated as :

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e34f19d6-2b87-4e8f-bdb2-51b2ee176d25)

Example Model and Graph :

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/109fe0ae-fe39-41cd-a5bf-8e991e2a6c48) 

--------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------


Thus we have an another case where we can apply a fixed DC bias Voltage (Vb) making sure that there is less variations of Vb upon change in circuit conditions like temperature etc, such that its maintained constant throughout.Taking the channel length modulation into consideration the Gain is provides as :

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/396a5ee1-4e4e-4127-9d81-9cca5a581aa2)

We also observe that this configuration has a larger gain than the diode connected load because ro,p is larger than 1/gm,p.

Example Model and Graph :

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d48919fe-9b9a-4b1a-846b-d71de5bca155)

Coming to the circuit , below is the circuit for PMOS Diode Connected Load model of L=2u and W=0.2u {for PMOS} and keeping  W=785n and L=800n {for NMOS}.

Based on the above 2 models we observed that connecting a bias DC Voltage to the gate is better than directly connecting gate and drain.

   Blue represents the Output Voltage and Input Voltage is Green. For input of 50mV its observed that Gain (calculated using peak-to-peak value) the Gain came out to be -2.6.

It was observed that the Gm value came out to be:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b00c1d2-24bc-4f5e-ab76-a0f31e46cae7)

SUMMARY / INFERENCE :

Thus as we observed, by properly having the W and L value using tsmc018.lib values its possible to get the desired value of current and to ensure the the power is stays inside the power budget limit. As we observe that the Values compared are same (approximate) with those of using Rd. Thus Rd can be replaced with Diode connected model of PMOS {using constant DC Bias Voltage}.

After analysis through various graphs and at temperature of 27 deg Celsius , the above were the graphs observed and noted.

OBSERVATIONS:

The final power calculated using Rd ; P=V*I= 1.8 * 27.19u == 48.942 uW.

And that of Power Calculated using PMOS ; P=V*I= 1.8 * 27.19u == 48.942 uW.

NMOS : W = 785n ; L = 800n

PMOS : W = 0.2u ; L = 2u

Vb : -5V

Vgs : 0.9V

Vdd : 1.8V

Rd : 25k


It was also observed that for L=180n and W=1.12u it was possible to get the drain current of 27.77uA with Vgs of 0.9V. But the condidtion for SATURATION was not completely satisfied as it was present at the edge of the saturation. Thus the Vgs was changed to 0.6V and it worked correctly. The other combinations like L=600n and W=0.2u and others was considered and checked.

Having the above combination also provided a very good gain and hence the above W & L were chosen to meet the requirements.

Thus both the Power is well within the Power Budget (50uW). Hence the design is verified.
